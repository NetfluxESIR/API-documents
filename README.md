# API Documents

This repository contains the API documentation of the backend of the Netflux ESIR project.

At first, we were thinking about add more documents relative to normative aspects of the API. But we decided to focus on the technical aspects of the API.

## API Documentation

You can find the following documents in this repository:

- [Video API documentation](./pkgs/video-api/README.md): the API documentation of the video API. The openapi specification is available [here](./pkgs/video-api/openapi.yaml) and are
used to generate the backend code.
